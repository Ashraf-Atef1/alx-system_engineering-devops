#### Timeline
- **13:00 UTC**: Issue detected by automated monitoring system; alerts sent to on-call engineers.
- **13:05 UTC**: On-call engineer confirms service outage and begins investigation.
- **13:15 UTC**: Initial assumption: recent deployment caused the issue; rollback initiated.
- **13:30 UTC**: Rollback completed, but issue persists; hypothesis about database performance degradation formed.
- **14:00 UTC**: Database team escalated; analysis shows no anomalies in database performance.
- **14:15 UTC**: Network team joins investigation; detailed analysis of network logs begins.
- **14:45 UTC**: Root cause identified as misconfigured load balancer following recent update.
- **15:00 UTC**: Load balancer configuration corrected and deployed.
- **15:30 UTC**: Service fully restored; monitoring confirms normal operation.

#### Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause**: 
During a routine maintenance update, a misconfiguration was introduced into the load balancer. Specifically, the new configuration inadvertently directed all incoming traffic to a single, non-functional backend server, causing the majority of user requests to fail with 503 errors.

**Resolution**: 
Upon identifying the misconfiguration, the network team quickly corrected the load balancer settings. This involved updating the load balancer configuration to properly distribute traffic across all available backend servers. A configuration test was run to ensure correctness, followed by a gradual traffic shift back to normal operations. Once the updated configuration was verified to be stable, full traffic was restored.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements**:
1. **Configuration Management**: Enhance procedures for updating and verifying configuration changes to critical infrastructure components.
2. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Improve monitoring to detect misconfigurations in load balancers and other critical services.
3. **Documentation and Training**: Ensure detailed documentation and regular training on maintenance procedures and incident response protocols.

**Tasks**:
1. **Patch Load Balancer Configuration**: Implement a patch to prevent similar misconfigurations in future updates.
2. **Add Monitoring on Load Balancer Traffic**: Deploy monitoring tools to analyze traffic patterns and alert on unusual distributions.
3. **Automated Configuration Validation**: Develop scripts to automatically validate load balancer configurations before deployment.
4. **Incident Response Review**: Conduct a review of the incident response process to identify and address gaps.
5. **Training Session**: Schedule a mandatory training session for the operations team on new procedures and tools.
6. **Documentation Update**: Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new procedures and configurations.
7. **Load Balancer Redundancy Check**: Ensure redundancy and failover mechanisms are correctly configured and tested regularly.

By addressing these areas, AcmeCorp aims to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future and to enhance overall system resilience and reliability.
